##Blender Python Add-on Debugging Support for Visual Studio Code

Prerequest: PTVSD module should have been installed (using pip to install), also the 'Python' (by Don Jaymanne) plugin of VSCode.

After this add-on installed and activated, press [Spacebar] then search 'connect', select "Connect to Visual Studio Code Debugger" to start forwarding debugging information to VSCode.

In VSCode, configure the debugger to "Remote", then you can start debugging in VSCode.
